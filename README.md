Goblin
======

A [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) like BDD testing framework for Go

Run tests as usual with `go test`

Colorful reports and beautiful syntax


Why Goblin?
-----------

Inspired by the flexibility and simplicity of Node BDD and frustrated by the
rigorousness of Go way of testing, we wanted to bring a new tool to 
write self-describing and comprehensive code.



What do I get with it?
----------------------

- Preserve the exact same syntax and behaviour as Node's Mocha
- Nest as many `Describe` and `It` blocks as you want
- Use `before`, `beforeEach`, `after` and `afterEach` for setup and teardown your tests
- No need to remember confusing parameters in `Describe` and `It` blocks
- Use a declarative and expressive language to write your tests
- Plug different assertion libraries (Gomega supported so far)
- Skip your tests the same way as you would do in Mocha
- Two line setup is all you need to get up running



How do I use it?
----------------

TODO: Put code example here

We do have a couple of [issues](https://github.com/franela/goblin/issues)pending we'd like to fix someday. Feel free to
contribute and send us some PR's (with tests please :smile:)
